## About Me

I am an upcoming MRes student at UoW. I completed my undergraduate degree in CS at SEU in China. After spending a year pursuing a MSc in CS at ANU, I decided to transfer to UoW to pursue a MRes. My research interests focus on RL.

### Interests

#### Occult

I self-study Bazi and Qimen Dunjia, and I have dabbled in tarot, astrology, Liu Yao, Liu Ren, and extraterrestrial topics. If you are interested in personal fate, feel free to contact me for a free consultation.

#### Rhythm Games

- Arcaea: PTT 11.4 [b30](https://github.com/eleven-dimension/eleven-dimension/blob/main/arcaea-b30-240728.jpg) (Ignore the records from over 900 days ago. Those were left by my friend. :satisfied:)
- Osu!mania: 4k, 4 Dan
- Currently playing: Cytus 1
- Occasionally play: Muse Dash, Osu! Standard, Phigros
- Arcade games: maimai DX, CHUNITHM, WACCA

#### Media Activities

- **Bilibili**: I occasionally post videos related to math and algorithms. During a break in January 2024, I frequently updated for a month and gained over 1k followers. If you have any questions or topics you want me to explain, feel free to contact me for a custom video.

- **Blog**: I sporadically post problem solutions, notes, and personal entries.

#### Vegetarianism

Recently, my grandmother was diagnosed with stomach cancer and underwent surgery that removed more than half of her stomach. This is the first time cancer has struck so close to me, and it has made me reflect deeply. Long ago, I came across a notion suggesting that many cancers are caused by vengeful souls, including those of animals. For example, if someone harms a cow severely in the belly, its soul might one day return for revenge, especially when that person's immunity is low, leading to illness. Interestingly, I recently learned that red meat has been scientifically linked to a higher risk of cancer. These two ideas overlap, making me wonder if there could be truth in the first, seemingly unbelievable, notion. 

To explore this, I've been reducing my meat intake, relying instead on eggs, soy, and oats for protein, and corn and rice for carbohydrates over the past few days. I plan to continue this experiment longer to observe any changes in my health.
