# Hi there, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹ ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=eleven-dimension&color=blue&style=flat-square)

## About Me

I am an upcoming MRes student at UoW. I completed my undergraduate degree in CS at SEU in China. After spending a year pursuing a MSc in CS at ANU, I decided to transfer to UoW to pursue a MRes. My research interests focus on Safe RL and Risk-Sensitive RL.

### Why Bother to Transfer?

To be continued...

---

I enjoy helping others and volunteered in the university's Q&A room during my undergraduate years. Due to my near-perfect score (99/100) in Probability Theory, I mainly assisted my peers with this subject and occasionally helped colleagues responsible for Mathematical Analysis. Perhaps I am suited to be a teacher.

I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning and data structures, with some interest in mathematics. Recently, I have realized that I do not enjoy coding in a corporate environment and aspire to pursue research in these areas in the future.

DP on trees is truly stupendous. Even if I were hired by a high-paying company and envied by others, if I could only write large simulations all day without experiencing anything magical, then I'd rather kill myself.

### Interests

#### Occult

I self-study Bazi and Qimen Dunjia, and I have dabbled in tarot, astrology, Liu Yao, Liu Ren, and extraterrestrial topics. If you are interested in personal fate, feel free to contact me for a free consultation.

#### Rhythm Games

- Arcaea: PTT 11.4 [b30](https://github.com/eleven-dimension/eleven-dimension/blob/main/arcaea-b30-240728.jpg) (Ignore the records from over 900 days ago. Those were left by my friend. :satisfied:)
- Osu!mania: 4k, 4 Dan
- Currently playing: Cytus 1
- Occasionally play: Muse Dash, Osu! Standard, Phigros
- Arcade games: maimai DX, CHUNITHM, WACCA

#### Media Activities

- **Bilibili**: I occasionally post videos related to math and algorithms. During a break in January 2024, I frequently updated for a month and gained over 1k followers. If you have any questions or topics you want me to explain, feel free to contact me for a custom video.

- **Blog**: I sporadically post problem solutions, notes, and personal entries.
